### Core Concepts

Understanding these core concepts will help you effectively use Everdo:

* **Inbox:** The default place for capturing new tasks and ideas quickly. Process your Inbox regularly to organize items into appropriate areas and projects.
* **Areas:** Represent broad categories of your life (e.g., Work, Personal, Health).  Use areas to group related projects and tasks.
* **Projects:**  Specific, goal-oriented endeavors with multiple tasks. Projects help break down large goals into smaller, actionable steps.
* **Tags:** Keywords or labels that you can assign to tasks and notes for flexible categorization and filtering (e.g., `#Urgent`, `#Meeting`, `#Errands`).
* **Notebooks:** Collections of related notes. Use notebooks to organize your notes by topic or project.
* **Contexts:**  Represent the situation or location where a task can be performed (e.g., `@Home`, `@Office`, `@Phone`). Contexts help you focus on relevant tasks based on your current situation.

### Basic Workflow

1. **Capture Tasks in the Inbox:** Quickly add new tasks and ideas to your Inbox as they come to mind.
2. **Process Your Inbox:** Regularly review your Inbox and organize items:
    * Assign tasks to **Areas** and **Projects**.

    * Set **Due Dates** and **Reminders** if needed.
    * Convert ideas into **Notes** in relevant **Notebooks**.
3. **Work from Your Lists:** Use the different views (Areas, Projects, Tags, Contexts, etc.) to focus on relevant tasks and work efficiently.
